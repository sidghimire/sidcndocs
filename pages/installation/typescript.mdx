# Typescript

NativeWind extends the React Native types via declaration merging. The simplest method to include the types is to create a new app.d.ts file and add a triple-slash directive referencing the types.

`app.d.ts`

``` typescript
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />
```

<div class="warning">
  ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not call this file nativewind.d.ts, it will cause your Typescript module resolution to fail.
