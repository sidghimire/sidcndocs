# Installing sidcn for Expo

## 1. Create the project

```bash copy
npx create-expo-app my-app
cd my-app
```

## 2. Install sidcn

```bash copy
yarn add sidcn
```
You will need to install nativewind and its peer dependency tailwindcss.



## 3. Initialize sidcn

```bash copy
npx sidcn init
```



That's it! ðŸŽ‰
You are now ready to start writing code using sidcn in your React Native CLI project.
