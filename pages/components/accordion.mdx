# Accordion Variants

The `Accordion` component in **sidcn** allows you to create interactive accordion sections within your React Native and Expo applications. With easy-to-use components, you can display and organize content in a collapsible manner, enhancing user experience.



<div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row",marginTop:40}}>
  <Image
    src="/assets/components/Accordion/Frame.svg"
    alt="Hello"
    width={250}
    height={250}
    style={{marginLeft:'auto',marginRight:10}}
  />
  <Image
    src="/assets/components/Accordion/Frame-1.svg"
    alt="Hello"
    width={250}
    height={250}
    style={{marginRight:'auto',marginLeft:10}}

/>


</div>

## Import Accordion

The primary variant is designed for the main action or call-to-action buttons.

```jsx copy
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent } from 'sidcn';
```

### How to use

Create individual accordion items with triggers and content.

```jsx copy
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Open Accordion 1
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This is accordion detail
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Open Accordion 2
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This is accordion detail
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Open Accordion 3
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This is accordion detail
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

```

`Use with className`

```jsx copy
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionTrigger className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 cursor-pointer">
      Custom Accordion Trigger
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="bg-gray-200 p-4">
      This is customized accordion detail
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```
